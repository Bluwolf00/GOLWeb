## Introduction

The Guerrillas of Liberation (GOL) is an online international milsim community that was established in 2003. The group primarily focuses on emulating realistic military tactics using the ArmA franchise developed by Bohemia Interactive - a realism based large scale sandbox shooter.

This project aims to provide a front facing image for the group and not only provide explaination and description on the group for potential visitors but also for information on certain group members (Rank, Awards, etc.)

## Overview

The website was created using NodeJS + Express for the back-end and routing. The front-end utilises Bootstrap and a few other JS libraries alongside it.
There are a few external libraries being used on the site:
- Bootstrap (As stated before)
- D3
  - Also including a forked repo for the org chart - [Org-Chart by bumbeishvili](https://github.com/bumbeishvili/org-chart/tree/master)
- JQuery

## Features

The site contains a variety of different features.

### Pages
