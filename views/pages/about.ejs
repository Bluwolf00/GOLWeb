                <p>
                    The Guerrillas of Liberation are an online military realism community that was founded in 2003 by a
                    group of young guys, making us one of the oldest groups in the ArmA community. The majority of our
                    members are based in Europe and come from all walks of life, whether they be a veteran, in active
                    service, a reservist or an enthusiast, we welcome all. Since 2003 the community has stood the test of
                    time, passing from one generation to the next, which brings us to today - <span

                <h3>What do we do?</h3>
                <p>
                    We are a realism unit, but we strike a great balance between realism and fun.
                    We are a group of like-minded individuals who enjoy playing ArmA 3 in a tactical and organized
                    manner.
                    We play as a team, using real-world tactics and strategies to complete our objectives.
                    We'll help you improve with training, and help you understand concepts from mission editing,
                    leadership,
                    air controllers, vehicle crewing, fire support and many more. We always want to encourage those who
                    want
                    to learn and grow.
                    Also, we are always looking to create and improve our missions to provide a fun yet challenging
                    experience.

                <h3>What are our operations like?</h3>
                <p>
                    Our operations are held on Thursdays and Sundays.
                    Thursdays are our training nights, where we complete at least an hour-long training on a specific
                    subject, followed by an optional 2-hour mission.
                    Sundays are our main events, where we complete a banger 3-hour mission. All of our missions are
                    built
                    in-house using our own custom framework for ArmA 3. This allows missions to be created quickly and
                    efficiently, and giving editors more time to focus on creating a fun and challenging experience for
                    our
                    members.
